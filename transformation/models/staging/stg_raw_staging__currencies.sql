{#
  Staging currencies model
  - Map '(none)'/blanks to NULL
  - Uppercase and take first 3 letters for codes; invalidate non Aâ€“Z
  - Deduplicate by (code, currency) so NULL-code currencies are kept individually
  - After that, take only rows with non-null codes 
  - Align date type with other staging models
